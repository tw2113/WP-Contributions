## Description

Provides an easy way to display your WordPress.org Themes, Plugins, Core tickets, and Codex contributions with handy widgets and template tags.

WordPress wouldn't be as amazing as it is without all of the contributors to the project. The community is proud of each and every contributor. Display some of your contributions to the project using handy widgets or template tags in your custom theme.  Currently, you can display your contributions to WordPress core, the WordPress Codex, your WordPress Plugins, or your WordPress themes.

There are four handy widgets available for you that are easily configured and added to your sidebar.  You just need to add your theme or plugin slug to display a theme or plugin or enter your WordPress.org username to display core or codex contributions.  

There are two shortcodes available, and some handy template tags if you desire to add them in your custom theme.  More info on shortcodes and template tags are available under the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions).

We want to give a big thanks to the great plugin, [Core Contributions Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-contributions-widget/) by Eric Mann, Michael Fields, John P. Bloch, Mike Bijon, and Konstantin Obenland. We forked part of this plugin to include Core and Codex Contributions. If you would just like widgets to display Core and Codex Contributions, we recommend downloading their plugin.

## Installation

1. Upload the `wp-contributions` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the WP Contributions plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Add widgets to your sidebars or place template tags in your templates.

### How do I add a widget?

1. Visit Appearance -> Widgets in your WordPress Admin.
2. Drag any of the WP Contributions widgets to the sidebar where you want them to appear.
3. For the plugin and them widgets, enter a widget title and enter the slug of the plugin you would like to display. The slug of a plugin can be found by looking at the URL of the plugin page.  For instance, Jetpack is found at `https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/` which makes the plugin slug `jetpack`.
4. For Core and Codex contributions, enter a title, your WordPress.org username, and the number of contributions you would like to display. It will display the most recent contributions. There will be a link to display more contributions so people can view any after the number you input.
